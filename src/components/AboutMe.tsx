              I'm Andres Marcos, and I'm conducting a self-funded search to acquire 
              and operate a single business. After years working in various industries, 
              I've learned that the most rewarding work happens when you're deeply 
              invested in something—not just financially, but personally.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This search is about finding the right fit. I'm looking for a company 
              where I can apply what I've learned, work alongside the existing team, 
              and build something meaningful over the long haul. I'm not interested 
              in quick exits or financial engineering—I want to run a business I'm 
              proud of.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I bring operational experience, a willingness to learn, and patient 
              capital that isn't beholden to external timelines or pressures. Most 
              importantly, I understand that buying a business is about more than 
              numbers—it's about respecting what's been built and carrying it forward 
              responsibly.
